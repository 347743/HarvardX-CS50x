sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Because it took the highest amount of time to sort, which is consistent with its O(n^2) Ω(n) time complexity.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because it took the least amount of time to sort, which aligns with its O(n log n) Ω(n log n) time complexity.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Because it took a moderate amount of time to sort, which is expected given its O(n^2) Ω(n^2) time complexity but fewer swaps compared to Bubble Sort.
